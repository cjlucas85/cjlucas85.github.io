Often shell scripting finds its away in tasks related to build systems, automated testing, source code management and similar tasks. These are all areas which well trained Software Engineers with good intentions have deemed a suitable tool for the job. They&amp;rsquo;re wrong. Instead of making things more streamline, a shell script will make things more unpredictable.</description>
